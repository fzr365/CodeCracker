# CodeCracker

A curated collection of LeetCode problem solutions in Java, written and maintained daily as part of a long-term commitment to mastering algorithms and data structures.

## 🔥 Motivation

This repository is part of my daily routine to solve at least one coding problem every day and become a better backend engineer through constant algorithmic sharpening.

## 📁 Folder Structure

```
java/
  └── difficulty/
      └── {problem_id}_{title}/
          ├── Solution.java
└── README.md
```

## 🚀 Progress
